I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science at Peking University, supervised by Prof. Daqing Zhang (Chair Professor, IEEE Fellow). I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from Peking University in 2023.

My research centers on pervasive computing, wireless sensing, and mobile computing, with a particular emphasis on developing innovative sensing systems to address real-world challenges in health monitoring, human-computer interaction, smart cities, and industrial operations. I have worked extensively with various signal modalities, including Wi-Fi, RFID, IMU, and GNSS. 

Currently, my work focuses on GNSS-based positioning and sensing applications.
